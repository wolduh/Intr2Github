Basic Plot in R
========================================================

Simple plot in R.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

xx <- rnorm(1000,4.5,2.0)
yy <- xx + rnorm(1000,0,2.0)
plot(xx, yy, main = "Plot of Original assay vs Modified assay")

```


Slide With Code
========================================================
How to define an object in r and assign values.

We don't want to make this too complicated but keep it simple

Here are a few things we need read apriori to understand this.


```{r}

a <- 25
b <- 35
c <- a + b

d <- a +c




```

Slide With Plot
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# here is a simple plot in r
aa <- rnorm(100,2,0.8) # generate a random sample from normal
bb <- rnorm(100,4,2.3) # generate  a random sample from normal
plot(aa,bb, col="red")
```
